India is facing extraordinarily damaging impacts of climate change. The remote nature of India’s climate movement means it is difficult to collectivise, unite together and realise climate action. The digital world gave us the space to organise, mobilise and connect with each other despite the distance. 

It’s reassuring to know that so many others share our concerns about the multiple crises facing our world. Knowing you’re not alone fosters hope, especially in times when despair is all too easy to feel. The hope is strengthened knowing that there are countless pockets where young people are steering through the challenges and building resilient support systems.

In January, the Youth Climate Convening 2024 took place in Bangalore. What began as virtual meetings turned into a powerful in-person gathering. Over three days of workshops, reflections, and presentations, we celebrated victories, confronted obstacles, and charted the course forward for the youth climate movement in India.

Young people are not passive bystanders in this crisis; we are leading the charge. Our advocacy centres on the most affected and marginalised communities, making climate justice a deeply intersectional struggle. But with so many environmental and socio-political challenges, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Youth climate collectives often face burnout, stretched thin by the enormity of the issues and the need to balance advocacy with personal well-being. This is why our Youth Climate Convening was essential—it gave us a space to reconnect, build support systems, and prioritise mental health alongside our work.

The convening started with a memorial for our friend Chandra, who passed away in 2023. Chandra, a queer climate activist, believed deeply in the power of community and collective action. They reminded us that in facing the climate crisis, we must stand together. The memorial allowed us to grieve and reflect on the values of compassion and solidarity that Chandra embodied. We got the space to remember them and their advocacy. It reaffirmed our commitment to take care of each other as we advocate for climate justice.

As Grace Lee Boggs said, “The only way to survive is by taking care of each other.” This became the heartbeat of the convening—emphasising the need to dismantle systems of oppression and inequality, and to actively work toward building a fairer, more just world.

Within movements, often unsafe spaces get replicated. How do we collectively fight if our spaces are unsafe for people to engage and stay? The Youth Climate Convening addressed the question of safety through a POSH training and resource sharing for the participants. This knowledge was crucial for ensuring that our movement remains a safe space for all.

The convening also allowed us to redefine our individual roles in the broader movement and foster a deeper sense of community. Through open discussions, we unearthed shared challenges—emotional turmoil, the struggle to balance our advocacy with personal life, and the difficulty of sustaining energy in the face of constant crisis. These dialogues forged bonds built on empathy, vulnerability, and solidarity, reminding us that we are stronger together.

At the core of our movement is a commitment to radical love and inclusivity. We are driven by principles of anti-caste and feminist organising, collective care, and decolonization. The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue; it is deeply tied to social justice. By addressing the root causes of environmental destruction, we amplify the voices of those most impacted and create space for everyone in our fight for climate justice.

The Youth Climate Convening 2024 is a beacon of hope in a world fraught with uncertainty. It reflects the unshakeable spirit of a generation determined to defy the status quo and create a just future. The road ahead will be difficult, but together, we can drive real change.

As we continue to organise, strategize, and fight for climate justice, we carry with us an important truth: our collective strength is our greatest asset. By centering radical love, elevating marginalised voices, and fostering solidarity, we can reach closer to climate justice and ecological harmony.
