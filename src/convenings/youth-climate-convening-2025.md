Walking into my first Youth Climate Convening (YCC), I’ll be honest—I was nervous. The kind of nervousness that comes with imposter syndrome whispering in your ear, telling you maybe you don’t belong here. On top of that, being late and facing multiple bumps in the road didn’t exactly help calm the nerves. In fact, it only added to my anxiety.

But the moment I arrived, I was met with warmth and understanding. The people around me didn’t judge—they just held space. And slowly, I started to feel a little more at ease, a little more comfortable.

**What unfolded over the next few days was nothing short of heartwarming and powerful.** It was amazing to witness the sheer amount of incredible work that people my age are doing—work that is bold, creative, and relentless. It reminded me that I’m not alone. That there are so many of us out there, showing up, doing the most for the movements and issues we’re deeply passionate about.

Over the three days, there were several sessions where the fellow participants shared their journeys, challenges and moments of joy. Our sessions led to building solidarity across movements and campaigns. The space was designed to be open to talk our hearts out through sessions and community baithaks. 

This was also an incredible space for me to learn—not just about climate issues, but about so many interlinked topics: indigenous rights, youth challenges, mental health, and more. **And what made it so powerful was how we learned. It wasn’t through long PowerPoint presentations or formal lectures—it was through conversations, shared meals, storytelling, and connection. That format helped me engage more deeply, understand more fully, and feel more prepared to share and mobilize with others.** It also gave me the confidence to step into more movements and collective causes—ones that continue to shape me into a more grounded, aware, and well-rounded person.

But even more than learning about others, I learned so much about myself. I learned to be a little more patient, to allow myself to be vulnerable, and to let myself be held by the community around me. This was a space where I could not only be supported but could also show up for others and hold space for them in return.

From thinking this experience would be overwhelming to forming lifelong friendships—this journey was a rollercoaster. There were moments of deep reflection, belly-aching laughter, a few tears, and, most powerfully, a shared, collective anger and passion directed toward the injustice happening around us.

I’m incredibly thankful for this opportunity. To the people I met, to the organizers, to the YCC—thank you. **Thank you for creating a space that doesn’t just talk about change, but actively nurtures it. A space that keeps hope alive and our passions burning strong.**

**Here’s to more spaces like this.** And, to showing up—again and again—for the planet, for each other, and for ourselves.
